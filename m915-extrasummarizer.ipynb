Although the diary was published in 1946 while Nijinsky was still alive, and the original handwritten volumes were sold at auction in 1979 for more than $100,000, a long-suppressed preface by the psychoanalyst Alfred Adler has now been printed for the first time, in The Archives of General Psychiatry.   The preface is the only published first-hand professional opinion of Nijinsky, whose mental illness led to consultations with all the foremost experts of his day, including Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung.  Its publication was prevented by Nijinsky's wife, Romola, who is said to have found its clinical observations distasteful, objecting in particular to Adler's belief that Nijinsky's schizophrenia was rooted in a pathological sense of inferiority.

Seven years ago, two medical scientists elucidated how this defect endangers its victims and how the body's cells use cholesterol. Now, they are studying promising new treatments that may have general application, preventing heart disease by drastically lowering blood cholesterol levels.   The doctors, Michael S. Brown and Joseph L. Goldstein of the University of Texas Health Sciences Center here, are known locally as ''the gold dust twins'' for the many prizes and generous private support their work has drawn. Their investigations revealed that some people are born with an error in the signaling system that regulates cholesterol production within the body. The result - an overabundance of cholesterol in the blood - renders such persons highly susceptible to clogging of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and an early death from heart disease.

The book's 15 essays highlight other lesser-known aspects of Jewish history as well: the influence of women; the lives of ordinary people; the efforts of Jews to help the Japanese interned during World War II; and the denial by Jews of the Israel expatriates who settled in Southern California.  Both groups found a kind of speedy mobility in the Golden State that allowed members to achieve power, place and financial success that their spiritual brothers and sisters on the East Coast would take decades to accomplish.  The organized Jewish community in California \"spent a lot of time not reaching out to them, not involving them and not making them public,\" Dollinger said, adding that the Israeli expatriates faced a struggle \"between the promised land of their birth and the promised land of their future.\"  Ultimately, as historians we're interested in cultural interaction,\" Dollinger said, \"how people mix elements of their Jewishness with their residence in the Golden State.

His songs were a flashlight in the dark, grappling head on with spirituality, drug addiction, and sexual appetites and behaviors that well beyond the Beatles’ “I Want to Hold Your Hand.” His native New York City was his palette, and he painted its more unsavory characters – junkies, hustlers, renegades – in broad strokes and vivid hues.

Here is the representative research.\nSentence Extraction Based Single Document Summarization\nFollowing features are used in the above method.\n\n1. Position of the sentence in the input document\n2. Presence of the verb in the sentence\n3. Length of the sentence\n4. Term frequency\n5. Named entity tag NE\n6. Font style\n\n…etc. All the features are accumulated as the score.\nThe No.of coreferences are the number of pronouns to the previous sentence. It is simply calculated by counting the pronouns occurred in the first half of the sentence. So the Score represents the reference to the previous sentence.\nNow we can evaluate each sentence. Next is selecting the sentence to avoid the duplicate of the information. In this paper, the same word between the new and selected sentence is considered. And the refinement to connect the selected sentences are executed.\nLuhn’s Algorithm is also feature base. It evaluates the “significance” of the word that is calculated from the frequency.\nYou can try feature base text summarization by TextTeaser (PyTeaser is available for Python user).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Unused","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# train_set = f\"..{os.sep}Data{os.sep}release{os.sep}train.jsonl\"\n# dev_set = f\"..{os.sep}Data{os.sep}release{os.sep}dev.jsonl\"\n# test_set = f\"..{os.sep}Data{os.sep}release{os.sep}test.jsonl\"\n# load json files and convert them to dataframes to load faster next time\n# train_df = funs.json_to_df(train_set,\"train\")\n# dev_df = funs.json_to_df(dev_set,\"dev\")\n# test_df = funs.json_to_df(test_set,\"test\")\n\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# colab command to download the dataset\n!kaggle datasets download -d tkylafi/summarizer-data","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
